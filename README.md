# World-Cup-2022-Data-Visuals

This repository contains automated data visuals of players' statistics in World Cup 2022. It can be used to analyze players' performances.

# Requirements

The packages used in the .ipynb file are:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib.pyplot
4. soccerplots.radar_chart

I created a conda environment in terminal that uses the requirements.txt file (contains the packages) to use the packages in Jupyter Notebook:
1. conda create -n "insert environment name" python = 3.7
2. conda activate "insert environment name" 
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
